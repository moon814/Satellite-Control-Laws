# Satellite-Control-Laws
Control Laws for various satellite actuators

This repo is meant to serve as a living and breathing library of various control laws. The inspiration comes from the name "Lyapunov" being written all over the white board in my undergrad advisor's office during a summer fellowship. I am here after many eons still very much interested in non-linear controls in any applications. However this repo will include non-linear and linear control laws for spacecrafts only. This will also include performance anlaysis of control laws. 

There will always be proper documentation both on code as well as supplementary notes. This is a promise I'd like to keep. 

Following is a back of the napkin list for what will be included imemediately and future additions:
1) Reaction Wheel control law for a S/C - [available: immediately][awaiting documentation]
2) Control Moment Gyro control law for a S/C - [available: immediately][awaiting documentation]
3) Control Moment Gyro - Steering Law - SRSL - [available: immediately][awaiting documentation]
4) Control Moment Gyro - Steering Law - Null Motion
5) Control Moment Gyro - Steering Law - Weighted Minimum 
6) Reaction Wheel and Thruster Control Law - [future plan]
7) 
8)
